# Example usage of TAMMBER
Example submit scripts and configuration files can be found in the
`sample-input/vac-Fe` directory. As most parameters can
be left unchanged, here we walk through what should be altered to run `TAMMBER`
on systems of interest to you!

- [File locations](#1)
- [Specifying initial configuration(s)](#2)
- [Configuring simulation parameters in `LAMMPS`](#3)
- [State identification](#4)
- [Cluster Definitions For Diffusion](#9)
- [Configuring the Markov model managing the sampling](#5)
  - [Crystal symmetry for diffusion tensor](#6)
  - [Parameters controlling accelerated sampling](#7)
  -[Test Routines](#8)
- [Analyzing output](#10)



## File locations<a name="1"></a>
When launching `TAMMBER` from some directory `execution-directory` it must
be able to find the configuration file in a directory named `input`,
i.e. the directory from where `TAMMBER` will be run **must** contain:
```bash
  execution-directory:
    input:
      ps-config.xml
```


We also need to provide an initial input configuration and interatomic potential,
which for this example are also in the `input` folder, giving for the present
example:
```bash
  execution-directory:
    input:
      ps-config.xml
      vac-Fe.dat # initial configuration
      Fe.eam.fs # interatomic potential (Marinica '07)
    sub.slurm # submit script
```

After a simulation, `TAMMBER` will write restart files (see [below](#8)) and so can be restarted from the same directory to continue sampling


## Specifying initial configuration(s)<a name="2"></a>
It is possible to seed `TAMMBER` with multiple initial configurations, but for
the moment we use only one, as specified above:
```xml
<!-- list of initial configurations; here we have one -->
<InitialConfigurations>
input/initial.dat
</InitialConfigurations>
```

## Configuring simulation parameters in `LAMMPS`<a name="3"></a>
Atomistic simulations are controlled with snippets of `LAMMPS` scripts,
so if you have used `LAMMPS` you should be able to use `TAMMBER` !

All terms in percent signs such as `%Temperature%` are fields which are filled
at runtime. Many are specified in the `TASK_XXX` tags at the bottom
of `input/ps-config.xml`

```xml
<LAMMPSEngine>
  <!-- Print logs for each LAMMPS worker. For debugging / test purposes only -->
  <LogLammps>0</LogLammps>
  <!-- Generic input script to load a configuration file %Filename%-->
  <InitScript>
    clear
    units metal
    atom_style atomic
    atom_modify map array sort 0 0.0

    pair_coeff * * input/Fe.eam.fs Fe

  </InitScript>

  <!-- Apply any external fixes after loading in config-->

  <!-- compute name must agree with that in TASK_CARVE -->
  <CarveComputeScript>
    compute centro all centro/atom 8
  </CarveComputeScript>

</LAMMPSEngine>
```

## State identification<a name="4"></a>
`TAMMBER` identifies states by first minimizing then creating a graph of bonds
between atoms that are closer than some cutoff. For each species pair, we
thus specify a cutoff. As some alloy potentials often have multiple "types"
for a single element (e.g. [eam/alloy](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_eam.html))
We also define a mapping from types to species index using a tag `<TypeMap>`.

For pure Fe, we use the `1/2<111>` bond length:
```xml
<!-- Criteria for connectivity graph -->
<StateLabeler>
  <Type> ConnectivityGraphStateLabeler </Type>
  <!-- Mapping between LAMMPS types and specie index -->
  <TypeMaps>
    <TypeMap>1 1</TypeMap>
  </TypeMaps>
  <!-- Cutoff criteria for graph -->

  <Bonds>
      <Bond>
          <Between> 1 1 </Between>
          <Cutoff> 2.664 </Cutoff>
      </Bond>
  </Bonds>  
</StateLabeler>
```
Whilst for NiAl, where Ni = type 1, Al = type 2,3, we have

```xml
<StateLabeler>
  <Type> ConnectivityGraphStateLabeler </Type>
  <!-- Mapping between LAMMPS types and specie index -->
  <TypeMaps>
    <TypeMap>1 1</TypeMap>
    <TypeMap>2 2</TypeMap>
    <TypeMap>3 2</TypeMap>
  </TypeMaps>
  <!-- Cutoff criteria for graph -->
  <Bonds>
      <Bond>
          <Between> 1 1 </Between>
          <Cutoff> 3.00 </Cutoff>
      </Bond>
      <Bond>
          <Between> 1 2 </Between>
          <Cutoff> 3.00 </Cutoff>
      </Bond>
      <Bond>
          <Between> 2 2 </Between>
          <Cutoff> 3.00 </Cutoff>
      </Bond>
  </Bonds>
</StateLabeler>
```


## Cluster Definitions For Diffusion<a name="9"></a>

For diffusion problems we want
- only one migrating object (this also makes sampling *much* more efficient)
- a position assigned to that object (much simpler post-processing if we can do this at runtime)
- knowledge of any self-symmetries of the object's structure (*significantly* accelerates sampling, as we don't have to find equivalent structures through unbiased MD)

### `MarkovModel`
In the `<MarkovModel>` tags we can restrict sampling to a single cluster with
```xml
  <ClusterThresh>1</ClusterThresh>
```
To disable this restriction, i.e. sample everything, we set
```xml
  <ClusterThresh>0</ClusterThresh>
```

###  `TASK_CARVE`
The 'carving' out of defects in `TAMMBER` is achieved in two steps, which we
illustrate using [centrosymmetry](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/compute_centro_atom.html). Example values are given below.


- In `<Scripts>`, define a `LAMMPS` compute which assigns a floating point number to each atom:
```xml
<!-- compute name must agree with that in TASK_CARVE -->
<CarveComputeScript>
  compute centro all centro/atom 8
</CarveComputeScript>
```
Multiple commands are possible, though only one compute can be used in the next step.
This compute should respect crystal symmetries, so that the carved region has the
same symmetries as the full system, allowing `TASK_SYMMETRY` to find all possible
symmetry operations. Most common "descriptors" (CNA etc) satisfy this.

- In `<TaskParameter>` for `TASK_CARVE`
  ```xml
  <TaskParameter>
    <Task> TASK_CARVE </Task>
    <Flavor> 0 </Flavor>
    <CarveCompute>centro</CarveCompute>
    <Threshold>0.1</Threshold>
    <RelativeCutoff>1.5</RelativeCutoff>
  </TaskParameter>
  ```
  - `CarveCompute` : the compute defined in `CarveComputeScript`. Carving is disabled if compute name is `NULL`.
  - `Threshold` : value of compute above which atoms are considered "defective"
  - `RelativeCutoff` : After carving, remaining atoms can be separated further than a nearest
  neighbor distance, even though they are the same cluster. This is most likely for vacancy defects-
  e.g. bcc vacancy leaves a "[100] cube cage" with atoms separated by <100>, not 1/2<111>.
  The `<Bond>` cutoffs are therefore rescaled by a factor `<RelativeCutoff>`, which
  should be approximately equal to (2nd nn bond length) / (1st nn bond length) (~1.5 for bcc)

We recommend using a visualisation program e.g. `OVITO` to determine the carving routine for your system.

Some example values with `LAMMPS` [centrosymmetry](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/compute_centro_atom.html)
parameter for various structures (alloys, surfaces) :

- Typically `centro/atom 6/12/8` is a good choice for cubic/fcc/bcc systems.

- No carving :
  ```xml
  <!-- compute name must agree with that in TASK_CARVE -->
  <CarveComputeScript></CarveComputeScript>
  ```
  ```xml
  <TaskParameter>
    <Task> TASK_CARVE </Task>
    <Flavor> 0 </Flavor>
    <CarveCompute>NULL</CarveCompute>
    <Threshold></Threshold>
    <RelativeCutoff></RelativeCutoff>
  </TaskParameter>
  ```

- MgO interstitial defect studied in [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-020-00463-8) :
  ```xml
  <!-- compute name must agree with that in TASK_CARVE -->
  <CarveComputeScript>
    compute centro all centro/atom 6
  </CarveComputeScript>
  ```
  ```xml
  <TaskParameter>
    <Task> TASK_CARVE </Task>
    <Flavor> 0 </Flavor> <!-- Default -->
    <CarveCompute>centro</CarveCompute>
    <!-- determined by inspection -->
    <Threshold>1.0</Threshold>
    <!-- Typically ratio of 2nd neighbor length to 1st -->
    <RelativeCutoff>1.5</RelativeCutoff>
  </TaskParameter>
  ```
- bcc vacancy:
  ```xml
  <!-- compute name must agree with that in TASK_CARVE -->
  <CarveComputeScript>
    compute centro all centro/atom 8
  </CarveComputeScript>
  ```
  ```xml
  <TaskParameter>
    <Task> TASK_CARVE </Task>
    <Flavor> 0 </Flavor> <!-- Default -->
    <CarveCompute>centro</CarveCompute>
    <!-- determined by inspection -->
    <Threshold>0.2</Threshold>
    <!-- Typically ratio of 2nd neighbor length to 1st -->
    <RelativeCutoff>1.5</RelativeCutoff>
  </TaskParameter>
  ```

- bcc 110 surface (note higher threshold!):
  ```xml
  <!-- compute name must agree with that in TASK_CARVE -->
  <CarveComputeScript>
    compute centro all centro/atom 8
  </CarveComputeScript>
  ```
  ```xml
  <TaskParameter>
    <Task> TASK_CARVE </Task>
    <Flavor> 0 </Flavor> <!-- Default -->
    <CarveCompute>centro</CarveCompute>
    <!-- determined by inspection -->
    <Threshold>5.0</Threshold>
    <!-- Typically ratio of 2nd neighbor length to 1st -->
    <RelativeCutoff>1.5</RelativeCutoff>
  </TaskParameter>
  ```

- bcc dislocation with fixed surfaces:
```xml
<!-- compute name must agree with that in TASK_CARVE -->
<CarveComputeScript>
  compute centro mobile_atoms centro/atom 8
</CarveComputeScript>
```
which assigns a value of zero for all atoms not in the group `mobile_atoms`, i.e. the surfaces
```xml
<TaskParameter>
  <Task> TASK_CARVE </Task>
  <Flavor> 0 </Flavor> <!-- Default -->
  <CarveCompute>centro</CarveCompute>
  <!-- determined by inspection -->
  <Threshold>1.0</Threshold>
  <!-- Typically ratio of 2nd neighbor length to 1st -->
  <RelativeCutoff>1.5</RelativeCutoff>
</TaskParameter>
```

###  `TASK_SYMMETRY`
Symmetry Comparisons for NEB pairs and self symmetries. One option is to use
the `VF2` graph matching [routine](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/libs/graph/doc/vf2_sub_graph_iso.html)
will be used, which has best case time complexity of O(N^2) but worst case O(N!N).
Whilst rare, this can cause simulations to hang for many minutes when waiting for `VF2` to finish.
Alternative is O(N^3) "brute force" remapping, which can be slower but has better worst case.
Carving out defects as described in the previous section therefore gives the best results-
```xml
<TaskParameter>
  <Task> TASK_SYMMETRY </Task>
  <Flavor> 0 </Flavor>
  <SelfCheck>1</SelfCheck>
  <ThreshCheck>1</ThreshCheck>
  <!-- use "brute force" remapping -->
  <UseVF2>0</UseVF2>
</TaskParameter>
```
- `SelfCheck` : Directly test for self symmetries. If not set, these symmetries will only be found during MD sampling.
- `ThreshCheck` : Carve out defective region using `TASK_CARVE` (much faster checks)
- `UseVF2` : force use of `VF2` matching



## Configuring the Markov model managing the sampling<a name="5"></a>

### Crystal symmetry for diffusion tensor<a name="6"></a>
Whilst not used during sampling, we must specify some structural properties to
allow the construction of the diffusion tensor in post processing. In particular,
we will need the lattice constant, primitive unit cell, the conventional unit cell
and the super cell.

For the primitive unit cell we can just specify the lattice type for bcc or fcc:
```xml
<!-- The following are equivalent : -->
<Lattice> 2.8552 bcc </Lattice> <!-- currently bcc or fcc only -->
```
Alternatively we can give the full cell and lattice constant as:
```xml
<Lattice>2.8552</Lattice>
<PrimitiveUnitCell>
-0.5 +0.5 +0.5
+0.5 -0.5 +0.5
+0.5 +0.5 -0.5
</PrimitiveUnitCell>
```

We then give the conventional unit cell in the same Cartesian basis but in lattice units:
```xml
<!-- Cartesian UnitCell vectors in lattice units-->
<UnitCell>
1.0 0.0 0.0
0.0 1.0 0.0
0.0 0.0 1.0
</UnitCell>
```


Finally, we specify the super cell vectors `[A,B,C]` from UnitCell or PrimitiveUnitCell
With UnitCell = `[a,b,c]`, give vector `v` such that `[A,B,C]=[v[0]xa,v[1]xb,v[2]xc]`
```xml
<SuperCell>7 7 7</SuperCell> <!-- i.e. A=a[700], B=a[070], C=a[007] -->
```
Alternatively, with PrimitiveUnitCell matrix `P`, give matrix `M` such that `[A,B,C]=MxP`
```xml
<SuperCell>
+0.0 +7.0 +7.0
+7.0 +0.0 +7.0
+7.0 +7.0 +0.0
</SuperCell>
```

### Parameters controlling accelerated sampling<a name="7"></a>
Perhaps the most important parameter to specify is the max temperature
for sampling. Using the available simulation data `TAMMBER` will estimate
the most suitable temperature to execute sampling within the range specified by
`<MinTemperature>` and `<MaxTemperature>`, but this currently relies on harmonic
transition state theory being valid, which in turn means no phase transitions etc!

As a result, it is best to limit `<MaxTemperature>` to approx. 80% of the melting temperature
or whatever experience with a particular system dictates, meaning for Fe we have
```xml
<!-- Lowest target temperature, in K -->
<TargetTemperature>300.0</TargetTemperature>
<!-- Temperature range for TAD sampling, steps inclusive -->
<MinTemperature>300.0</MinTemperature>
<MaxTemperature>600.0</MaxTemperature>
<TemperatureSteps>7</TemperatureSteps>
```

We also have to control how jobs are allocated.

Choice of initial distribution:
0: Delta function on first state in InitialConfigurations
1: Boltzmann on all discovered states
2: Uniform on all states (good to drive discovery for single funnel landscapes)
```xml
<RhoInitFlavor> 1 </RhoInitFlavor> <!-- i.e. Boltzmann -->
```

Scheme used to allocate workers:
0: Such that validity time increases as fast as possible (within available info)
1: Proportional to probability of finding new event from state
```xml  
<AllocScheme> 0 </AllocScheme>
```

Finally, two extra parameters which can help finish a sampling task.

For testing, we have a `NEBPolicy` to determine if we run MD and NEB, 
only NEBS, or only MD

As we specify a fixed simulation time, there may be incomplete `NEB` calculations
at the end of a run, meaning the constructed model is incomplete. There is thus
an option to execute only `TAMMBER`
```xml
  <!--
  0: Normal operation, MD and NEB
  1: Only complete remaining NEBs
  2: Only run MD, no NEBS
  -->
  <NEBPolicy> 0 </NEBPolicy>
```

During sampling, we can also use dynamical information to estimate
the result of pending NEB calculations, which obviously will be overwritten
once those calculations are complete.
```xml
  <!--
  Use dynamic information to estimate the result of pending NEB calulations.
  -->
  <EstimatePendingNEBS>0</EstimatePendingNEBS>
```
*If* no completed NEBS are available for a state-to-state connection,
`tammber-analyze` will use this information in the processed Markov model
(see the [Analyzing output](#10) section)

## Test Routines<a name="8"></a>
We *strongly* recommend building `tammber-md` which will attempt to
- load in starting configuration
- carve out defective region if `ThreshCheck==1`
- check for self symmetries (if if `SelfCheck==1`)
- generate an MD segment at lowest simulation temperature
- look for transitions

This will produce a verbose output which can be very useful to check if your
simulation will run as expected. It can be ran on two cores, with e.g.
```bash
cd execution-directory
mpirun -np 2 /path/to/tammber/build/tammber-md
```
The output will be printed to the screen-
- search for `NClusters` to see results of the carving routine
- search for ``CURRENT LABEL` and `TRANSITION DETECTED` to see results of MD

Future versions will have friendlier testing routines!

## Analyzing output<a name="10"></a>
After a simulation run, you will see the following files:
```bash
  execution-directory:
    input:
      ps-config.xml
      vac-Fe.dat # initial configuration
      Fe.eam.fs # interatomic potential (Marinica '07)
    db0:
      min.db # database of configurations
      min.offsets # their location
    TammberModel.chk # restart file
    output.slurm # slurm output, if using slurm...
    err.slurm # slurm output, if using slurm...
    sub.slurm
```

To construct the input file for our python scripts, run `tammber-analyze`:
```bash
cd execution-directory
/path/to/tammber/build/tammber-analyze
```
This will produce a file `MarkovModel.xml` which is read by the `tammberAnalysis`
python package provided `process/tammberAnalysis.py`, with example usage in
`process/Diffusion_Model_example.ipynb`

To extract all configurations for your own analysis, run `tammber-dbextract`
on two cores:
```bash
cd execution-directory
mpirun -np 2 /path/to/tammber/build/tammber-dbextract
```
